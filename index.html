      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a biology student with a passion for organic chemistry and genetics. I currently work in the wine industry educating guests about different varietals and wine making techniques. I have a cute little cat named Arthur, who always keeps me on my toes.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from the Napa Valley originally, but have recently migrated to the Pacific Northwest!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Being a student with a job doesn't offer much free time for hobbies, but when I find some extra time I usually try to spend it reading, doing embroidery, or spending time with family.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would consist of a postive team environment, continuing education and learning opportunities, and a healthy work-life balance.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Pacific Northwest</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Technology is an ever-growing field and I want to be able to be a part of it. There are a ton of different, exciting oppurtunities within tech and I would be foolish not to acquire web development skills.</p>
